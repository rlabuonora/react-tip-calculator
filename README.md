## My process

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Good practice with responsive design using flexbox and React's `useState` hook.


### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos's flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [React Hooks in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/react-hooks-in-action) - The best resource I've seen so far on React.
